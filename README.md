# POAP-like Course Completion Proof – NFT Badges

## 📝 Project Description
This Clarity smart contract provides a proof-of-attendance protocol (POAP)-like system where students receive **NFT badges** upon completing specific courses. Each badge is uniquely tied to the course and the student, serving as a verifiable proof of completion.

## 🌟 Project Vision
The project envisions a decentralized academic verification platform where learners can showcase their educational achievements using tamper-proof blockchain credentials.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Add badge metadata (e.g., course details, institution).
- Integrate frontend dashboard to display NFT achievements.
- Enable badge transfer with permissions.
- Link with educational dApps for automatic minting after course completion.
